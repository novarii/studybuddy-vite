This folder centralizes internal documentation for StudyBuddy. Start here to understand what exists and where to find it.

## Directory Map
- **System**
  - [`project_architecture.md`](System/project_architecture.md) — Full overview of the tech stack, repo layout, runtime architecture, and data models.
- **SOP**
  - [`feature_workflow.md`](SOP/feature_workflow.md) — Step-by-step checklist for planning, building, and validating new features.
- **Tasks**
  - [`llm-chat-prd.md`](Tasks/llm-chat-prd.md) — Product brief and implementation plan for replacing mock chat responses with a real LLM backend.

## How to Use These Docs
1. Read the System doc first to get architectural context and current constraints.
2. Consult the SOP while you implement or review changes to ensure consistency with the codebase conventions.
3. Review open Tasks/PRDs to understand current priorities and the expected plan of record before starting new work.

Keep this index updated whenever you add, rename, or remove documentation so new engineers can navigate the repo quickly.
