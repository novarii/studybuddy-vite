# .agent Index

This folder centralizes internal documentation for StudyBuddy. Start here to understand what exists and where to find it.

## Directory Map
- **System**
  - [`project_architecture.md`](System/project_architecture.md) — Full overview of the tech stack, runtime architecture, CopilotKit agent wiring, and backend contracts.
- **SOP**
  - [`feature_workflow.md`](SOP/feature_workflow.md) — Step-by-step checklist for planning, building, and validating new features.
- **Tasks**
  - _No active PRDs in `Tasks/` yet. Add one doc per feature when a product brief and implementation plan exists._

## How to Use These Docs
1. Read the System doc first to get architectural context and current constraints.
2. Consult the SOP while you implement or review changes to ensure consistency with the codebase conventions.
3. Review open Tasks/PRDs to understand current priorities and the expected plan of record before starting new work.

Keep this index updated whenever you add, rename, or remove documentation so new engineers can navigate the repo quickly.
